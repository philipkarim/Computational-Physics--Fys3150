This course gives an introduction to several of the most used algorithms from numerical analysis to solve problems in the Sciences. 
These algorithms cover topics such as advanced numerical integration using Gaussian quadrature, Monte Carlo methods with applications to random processes, Markov chains, integration of multidimensional integrals and applications to problems in statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Other methods which are presented are eigenvalue problems, from the simple Jacobi method to iterative Krylov methods. Popular methods from linear algebra such as the LU-decomposition method and spline interpolation are also discussed.
